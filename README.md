# BagofTricks-LT

This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of AAAI-21 paper [Bag of Tricks for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/zhangys/papers/AAAI_tricks.pdf), which provides practical and effective tricks used in long-tailed image classification. 

Codes are being reorganized and will come in a few days.
